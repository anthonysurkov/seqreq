Note: my_phylo.py relies on iqtree-2.4.0, which is not included with this repo.

my_phylo.py - all utility functions responsible for CFN (JC2) model, ML estimation, graph generation, etc.
all other files (balanced_binaery.py, caterpillar.py, etc) generate trees according to different combinatorial structures.
